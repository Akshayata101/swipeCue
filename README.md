# swipeCue

**swipeCue** is a lightweight computer vision tool built with Python that allows hands-free control of presentations using a red object — such as a marker cap — to swipe through slides with simple gestures.

## Motivation

During tech talks, lectures, and virtual meetings, presenters often face interruptions while switching slides — whether it's walking back and forth from the podium or depending on clickers and remotes. **swipeCue** eliminates these distractions by transforming a simple red object into a smart, touch-free remote. With just a swipe of your hand, you can glide through your presentation effortlessly, stay engaged with your audience, and deliver your content with confidence and flow.
